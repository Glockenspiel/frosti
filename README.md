## Rules
- There is 4 players on each team and 2 rounds
- Each team will be assigned to the attackers or defenders
- The attackers must escort a payload along a fixed path in a given amount of time
- There is checkpoints along the path which add more time to the clock
- The defenders must stop the attackers progress
- The round ends when the attackers get to the end of the path or when their time runs out
- At the end of the round both teams swap sides
- Which ever team pushes the payload the furthest or gets to the end of the path the fastest wins

## Features

- Jump Pads
- Custom Map
- Falling of the map
- Payload navigating along a path
- Custom UI elements
